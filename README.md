## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data üåßÔ∏è ##

- The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Either Pandas or Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. The columns have the correct headings and data types.

- The data was analyzed to answer the following questions:

  - How many months exist on Mars?
  
  - How many Martian days' worth of data are there?
  
  - The data was analyzed to answer the following questions, and a data visualization was created to support each answer:
  
    - Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?
    
    - Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
    
    - How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made.
    
    - The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file.
